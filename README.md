## Roadmap (TODO)

- **Duplicate Key Prevention**: Add functionality to prevent duplicate key bindings, including warning or confirmation prompts.
- **Prevent Specific Keys**: Option to block certain keys from being rebound.
- **Modifier Keys Support**: Allow modifiers like SHIFT, CTRL, etc., to be used in rebinding.
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: Automatically scan input actions and build the UI, reducing manual work in placing prefabs.
- **Enhanced Search**: Improve the search feature to allow users to find actions by listening for key presses (e.g., press "E" to highlight the action associated with "E").

This is a quick prototype designed for experimentation.
Uses [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/documentation/user-interface-overview) to pack the prompt sprites.


# This project requires DOTween Pro, which is not included because it's paid third-party software.  
You can easily do without it or replace it with another tweening library. I used it because it's the simplest solution I know, but it's entirely optional.
