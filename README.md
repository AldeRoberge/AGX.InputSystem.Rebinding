## Roadmap (TODO)

- **Duplicate Key Prevention**: Add functionality to prevent duplicate key bindings, including warning or confirmation prompts.
- **Prevent Specific Keys**: Option to block certain keys from being rebound.
- **Modifier Keys Support**: Allow modifiers like SHIFT, CTRL, etc., to be used in rebinding.
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: Automatically scan input actions and build the UI, reducing manual work in placing prefabs.
- **Enhanced Search**: Improve the search feature to allow users to find actions by listening for key presses (e.g., press "E" to highlight the action associated with "E").
